Think of our data analysis like preparing a large meal. Right now, we're using a single chef (your computer's processor) to do all the tasks sequentially. There are several ways we can make this process faster:

1. **Using Parallel Processing**
```python
import multiprocessing as mp
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

# Set up parallel processing
n_cores = mp.cpu_count()  # Use all available CPU cores
```

This is like having multiple chefs working simultaneously. Each core handles a different part of the calculation independently.

2. **GPU Acceleration**
```python
# If you have RAPIDS installed
import cudf
import cupy as cp

# Convert pandas DataFrame to GPU DataFrame
gpu_features = cudf.DataFrame.from_pandas(scaled_features)
```

This is similar to using industrial-grade kitchen equipment instead of home appliances. GPUs can process large amounts of numerical data much faster than CPUs.

3. **Dask Framework**
```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Convert to Dask DataFrame
dask_features = dd.from_pandas(scaled_features, npartitions=n_cores)
```

Dask is like having an efficient kitchen management system. It breaks down the work into smaller chunks and processes them intelligently, either sequentially or in parallel.

The choice between these methods depends on your setup:
- If you have a multi-core CPU → Use parallel processing
- If you have a NVIDIA GPU → Use RAPIDS/cuDF
- If you're working with very large datasets → Use Dask

For your current analysis, I would recommend starting with parallel processing since it's the simplest to implement and doesn't require additional hardware. Here's how to modify your existing code execution:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Enable parallel processing
    from joblib import parallel_backend
    
    with parallel_backend('multiprocessing', n_jobs=n_cores):
        final_features = prepare_features_for_clustering(scaled_features, original_features)
```

This approach should significantly reduce the processing time without requiring any changes to your analysis code. Would you like me to explain how to implement any of these approaches in more detail?
